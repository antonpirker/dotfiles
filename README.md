# dotfiles

This is my little try to have the configuration of my development notebook in one place. Currently it is basically one config file, that includes two others setting up a nice bash prompt and pyenv.


### Installation

It is important that there is the `dotfiles` directory in the home directory.

```
echo ". ~/dotfiles/anton_bash_setup" >> ~/.bashrc 
```
